This API challenge gets the JSON from the API that I created, and stores the information into a map of structs. 

##the API I used:
https://github.com/omarsagoo/makescraper_v1

This API scrapes news.google.com and stores all of their articles(titles, authors, dates, links, and all related articles with the same information) into JSON format.
